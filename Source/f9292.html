<h3>A Catalogue of the Complete Collected Works of the Omniscient King of Dharma, Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Getse MahÄpaá¹á¸ita Gyurme Tsewang Chokdrup</em></strong></p>
<p><em>bhavaá¹ duá¹£Äá¹ secanajÃ±Änacaká¹£ur<br/>

<p><em>With your eye of wisdom, you eliminate all the faults of existence.<br/>
Having gone to the other shore of great purity,<br/>
You are a mirror that reflects all phenomena.<br/>
Your name, Self-Arisen Vajra,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> adorns this world.</em> </p>
<p><em>The Buddhaâs liberating wisdom is like an ocean, a swelling stream of pacifying nectar.<br/>
Through the power of great compassion, his vast, unrestricted path extends boundlessly, throughout the whole of space and time,<br/>
And removes the torment of saá¹sÄra without end; his speech is the supreme Dharma, from which the divisions of the Saá¹gha aroseâ<br/>
These three manifest as spiritual friends in the form of wondrous treatises.</em> </p>
<p>Our teacher, who is unrivalled throughout the three realms, is known everywhere in this world as the great omniscient Rangjung Dorje Jigme Lingpa. Here I shall give a concise account of the first edition of his collected writings published in numerous volumes. This has three parts: 1) a concise biography of Jigme Lingpa, 2) the actual catalogue, and 3) the conclusion: showing the benefits of this meaningful endeavor, and dedication and aspiration prayers</p>
<h2>1. A Concise Biography of Jigme Lingpa</h2>
<p>In reality, our teacher is just as Lord Maitreya described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A buddha simultaneously displays a variety of deedsâ<br/>
In some places turning the Dharma Wheel in many hundreds of ways, in some taking birth, in others not appearing,<br/>
In some showing different styles of birth, in some every kind of awakening, and in some the parinirvÄá¹a,<br/>
And yet all these are demonstrated without moving from that state.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the great pure realm of the Unsurpassed, immeasurable and without limit or centre, there has always been the naturally arisen wisdom of uncompounded reality, Samantabhadra, who is the essence of awareness itself, the primordial Buddha. The cakravartins of the maá¹á¸alasâwhich have the nature of the illusory net and are endowed with all the supreme qualitiesâthe rulers of the great kingdoms of Dharma adorned with the seven aspects of union, are the tathÄgatas of the five families, Mahottara Heruka, VajrayoginÄ« and others who all enjoy the unending ornamentational wheels of body, speech, mind, qualities and activities. They never waver from the great display. As the <em>Sublime Continuum</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as on the pure ground of beryl<br/>
The reflection of the body of the lord of gods appears,<br/>
So on the pure ground of the minds of beings,<br/>
The reflection of the body of the Lord of Sages dawns.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This citation shows that on the absolute level, the perfect Buddha Samantabhadra abides free from the extremes of singularity or plurality. Yet from that state, on the relative level and in accordance with the agent and the objects to be known, for extremely pure disciples, somewhat pure disciples, and impure disciplesâthe thus-gone buddhas, tenth-level bodhisattvas, and in the perception common to ordinary and noble beingsâhe appears in various innumerable forms such as, respectively, the sixth family lord of the victorious ones, the great saá¹bhogakÄya which is the self-appearance of basic space, the half-nirmÄá¹akÄya, half-saá¹bhogakÄya and the supreme nirmÄá¹akÄya. These displays of oceans of kÄyas appear at once in a single instant within oceans of infinite pure realms, in unlimited ways and perform an incalculable variety of enlightened deeds. The Buddha matures beings in oceans of realms and appears, dependent on the perceptions of those to be tamed, in the form of bodhisattvas, noble ÅrÄvakas, siddhas, paá¹á¸itas, ÅrÄmaá¹as, brahmins, universal monarchs, Brahmas, Indras, the kingdomsâ vassal kings, ministers, householders, gods, nÄgas and yaká¹£as; as lions, horses, elephants, birds and deer, medicinal trees, edible plants, food, boats and bridges. All of these appearances manifest in order to tame beings in harmony with their constitutions, faculties and habitual tendencies; through skillful means he emanates in all of these different ways. With the indestructible play of the illusory net, he manifests infinite bodies and unending speech, through which he reveals countless gateways to the Dharma. He leads some disciples to the higher realms, some onto the path of definite goodness, and some he establishes in the pathâs result. </p>
<p>Childish, ordinary beings like us fail to comprehend this. Our minds are biased and conceptual, and thus the only thing we are able to understand is as follows: The glorious Vajrasattva himself emanated as Devaputra Adhicitta in order to spread the Great Perfection teachings in the realm of the gods. In this world of human beings he emanated as the nirmÄá¹akÄya teacher Garab Dorje, who was the first to reveal the teachings which are the heart of the Supreme Vehicle. During the time of Buddha KÄÅyapa he was born as the son of King Ká¹kin. In the perception of ordinary beings, it was then that he generated the mind set upon supreme awakening for the first time. During the time of our Teacher [ÅÄkyamuni Buddha] he manifested as Nanda. In Tibet he manifested as the monk Akaramati, emanated by King Songtsen Gampo, and then as King Tri SongdetsenâMaÃ±juÅrÄ« in person, Princess Pema Sal, Gyalse Lharje, Yarje TertÃ¶n Orgyen Lingpa, the Omniscient DrimÃ© Ãzer, Ngari Paá¹chen Rinpocheâthe Mighty Lotus King, ChÃ¶gyal PÃ¼ntsok from Drikung, the treasure-revealer Tashi Tobgyal Wangpode, master of the Northern Treasures, and Dzamling Dorje, the treasure revealer from Kongpo. In this way he manifested in a variety of forms, according to what was appropriate. Yet all of these emanations are in reality a single succession of births and are of one mind. Then, finally, as the vajra prophecies of the Great Master of Uá¸á¸iyÄna found in the treasures of Orgyen Lingpa state: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the district of Yor in Central Tibet will come a bodhisattva called Pema.<br/>
He will maintain the Nyingma Kama teachings and tame beings through his skill in means. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This citation shows that in this life, he will uphold both the lineage of explanation and the lineage of practice of the Early Translation Schoolâs Kama teachings. Furthermore, the sealed prophecies of the Embodiment of the Guruâs Wisdom (Lama GongdÃ¼)<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> and other sources clearly reveal the unchanging linchpin of signs, omens and bodily marks that he will possess. </p>
<p>In particular, in accordance with the indestructible oath that the master Vimalamitra himself tookâthat at a time when the profound Heart-Essence teachings have become almost imperceptible, like a tiny creek in autumn, he would emanate in the manner of a scholar and restore the teachings of the Heart-Essenceâthe great paá¹á¸ita Vimalamitra, crown ornament of five hundred scholars, appeared in this land of snowy peaks as the Omniscient Rangjung Dorje Jigme Lingpa. </p>
<p>This holy being had always been completely awakened to the nature of all phenomena. He did not need to depend on listening to, contemplating and meditating upon the mere words of the Dharma like an ordinary person. Yet, in order to set a good example for disciples, he nevertheless proceeded gradually in studying and practicing the teachings. From ordinary spiritual friends, he received without ever being satiated the nectar of the Dharma consisting mainly of the Kama teachings. Then, when his mind and Buddha family were awakened, he had such measureless renunciation that he perceived the whole of worldly existence as a pit of fire and imagined himself to be among ferocious animals and savage men. Motivated by disenchantment, he focused one-pointedly and diligently on the most vital practices at Palri Monastery. At that time, he had visions within the expanse of great luminosity of the extraordinary Guruâthe lord of the families and second BuddhaâPadmasambhava, as well as the great master MaÃ±juÅrÄ«mitra. He received the symbolic and ultimate empowerment beyond conceptual elaborations many times. Thereafter, realization arose spontaneously; any grasping at experiences vanished; his karmic winds were brought under control; the false cave of appearances collapsed; and his awareness was tempered and became pliable. Whatever appeared to him became boundless, infinite purity; all phenomena burst forth as dhÄraá¹Ä«s and the treasures of confidence. When looking at external appearances, all conventional designations and knowable objects were perceived as a mere veil. Yet in order to guide childish beings, he illuminated [the conventional truth] impartially and unhindered. The knots in his chakra of enjoyment dissolved into all-pervading space, and all the movements of his channels and wind-energies transformed into clouds of syllables. All sounds burst forth as the melody of the inexpressible, indestructible supreme nÄda. All appearances arose as symbols and scriptures. He was able to comprehend anything that happened as pith instructions, and he wrote <em>The Mirror of Wisdom and Love: A Detailed Commentary on the Ritual of the Embodiment of the Guruâs Wisdom</em>. At the age of twenty-eight,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> his rapture of devotion for the great master Padmasambhava, the lord of the families, caused all eighty ordinary conceptualizations to dissolve into all-pervading space. In that instant, the Lord Padmasambhava himself appeared flying in the sky, riding a lion. A wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ« placed a casket in his hands, which read as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For disciples with pure perception,<br/>
You are Tri Songdetsen.<br/>
For disciples with impure perception,<br/>
You are Senge Repa.<br/>
This is the treasure of Samantabhadraâs wisdom mind,<br/>
The symbols of VidyÄdhara Padmaâs vast expanse,<br/>
The great secret treasury of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s. Let the signs be absorbed.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately boundless joy arose in his mind. He opened the casket and found five rolls of yellow scrolls and seven crystal beads the size of peas. He consumed them, and the words and meaning [of the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse] appeared vividly and clearly in his mind, as if they had been imprinted there. For seven years he kept them hidden within the expanse of his realization.</p>
<p>Then, while he was practicing one-pointedly in order to obtain the supreme accomplishment at the great black charnel ground of Chimphu, he had three visions of the wisdom body of the future Buddha Rirab Marme Gyaltsen, the Great Omniscient Drime Ãzer.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> First, he received the blessing of his enlightened body and the ultimate transmission of the words and their meaning. Secondly, he received the blessing of his enlightened speech, empowering him as the ultimate regent of the Omniscient King of Dharma himself. He was entrusted with the teachings of the Seven Treasuries and the Three Chariots and mastered the excellent tenets of the ultimate, definitive meaning. He was empowered to teach them widely to others so that the teachings would not wane. In this way, his enlightened activities of explanation and composition of the authentic Secret Mantra became vast. Finally, he received the blessing of Longchenpaâs enlightened mind and became the regent of Samantabhadra. He was empowered by the transference of blessing of the powerful radiance of awareness, the suchness beyond all expression, and mastered the realization of the ultimate lineage.</p>
<p>At that time, he composed his <em>Words of the Omniscient One</em> and other texts, which contain few words yet are vast in meaning. <em>The Answers to Khariâs Questions</em>,<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> which contains prophecies revealed by Guru ChÃ¶kyi Wangchuk, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the East or South of the Red Tombs,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a><br/>
It is possible that a monastery will be established with a Descent from Heaven stÅ«pa. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In accordance with this prophecy, on a ridge in the direction of the auspicious tomb of King Songtsen and not far from the temple of Yoru Tradruk,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> in the midst of a forest of bodhi trees, the temple of Tsering Jong was constructed and filled with sacred objects. It is here that Jigme Lingpa turned the wheel of Dharmaâuninterruptedly, elaborately and without biasâto an assembly of Dharma practitioners, emphasizing the collection of teachings of the vidyÄdhara-bodhisattvas. </p>
<p>At that time, the principal á¸ÄkinÄ« of the five families created the auspicious interdependent conditions to open the gateway to the Dharma and decipher the symbolic scripts. The time had now come to write down the son scriptures of the Dharma of the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse, the mind treasures which Jigme Lingpa had revealed earlier; thus he wrote down clearly the most vital, crucial points. </p>
<p>It is certain that when Jigme Lingpa was thirty-five years old,<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> in the Wood Monkey year (1764), on the tenth day of the Monkey month,<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> he performed an offering ritual during which he had a vision of the Great Master of Uá¸á¸iyÄna together with a gathering of heroic ones and á¸ÄkinÄ«s. In conformity with this vision, his first fifteen disciplesâincluding several holy beings who had all made excellent aspirations in the pastâgathered around him. It was to them that he first taught the ripening and liberating instructions of the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse. From then onwards, he taught the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse to suitable disciples, and it spread widely. </p>
<p>The Great Omniscient Longchenpa had previously entrusted him with all his teachings and enthroned him as his ultimate regent, based on which Jigme Lingpa composed, in verse, <em>The Rain of Joy: The Treasury of Precious Qualities</em>, which teaches the complete meaning of the Seven Treasuries and the Three Precious Chariots in a single text. He also composed an elaborate commentary on the meaning of its words in two parts. The first part, <em>The Chariot of the Two Truths</em>, covers the Vehicle of Characteristics, and the second part, <em>The Chariot of Omniscience</em>, extensively establishes the ground, path and fruition of the Resultant Vehicle of Mantra in general, and of the Clear Light Great Perfection in particular. With the plumb line of scripture and reasoning he established the foundation for the philosophical tenets of the vajra essence teachings. Within the valleys of the snowy mountains of Tibet, he tore down the martial banners of arrogance belonging to professors of logic who boast loudly of their own erudition. They then showered him with flowers of praise and joyfully bowed in reverence before him. In this manner, he eliminated the darkness of misguided thoughts among those who considered the followers of the Early Translation School to be ignorant concerning the various piá¹­akas, and thus caused the sun of pure perception to shine. His kindness in performing this one deed alone would be difficult for us ever to repay. </p>
<p>Unable to bear that the precious texts of the complete Collection of Tantras of the Early Translation School, the fruit of the amazing wisdom of the emanated Dharma King and bodhisattva translators and scholars, might go to waste, he compiled them anew. Some of the great scholars of the later translations, such as ButÃ¶n<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a>âone of the first to proclaim his partiality and biasâwith their blurred vision failed to include the sections of the tantras of the three yogas within the Kangyur, with the exception of a few texts. This, they claimed, was based on reason: the names of those tantras could not be found in the chronicles or catalogues. Yet with profound and vast confidence, and backed by the three types of evidence,<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> this holy lord Jigme Lingpa composed <em>An Ornament that Illuminates Every Corner of the World: A History of the Precious Collection of Tantras of the Earlier Translation School</em>. With logic and scripture he swept away and cleansed all stains of misguided thought.</p>
<p>In a vision of Lang Palgyi Sengeâs wisdom body, Jigme Lingpa received the sign that he had been empowered into the emanated maá¹á¸ala of VajrakÄ«laya.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> Here in the Snowy Land of Tibet, there are several transmissions of VajrakÄ«laya, of which the main ones are the Tradition of the King, the Tradition of Jomo, and the Tradition of Cham, yet ultimately their wisdom intent is one. Empowered in his vision, and having gathered all these various traditions, the interdependent circumstances were complete for Jigme Lingpa to arrange such tantras as the <em>VajrakÄ«laya Great NirvÄá¹a Tantra</em>, the <em>Vajra Array</em>, the <em>Great Yoga</em>, the <em>Wisdom Peak</em>, and the <em>Great Yoga Root Tantra</em>, and compile them into means for accomplishment (<em>sÄdhanas</em>). Such a collection had never been compiled before. Here I can only mention the main points and will not elaborate on all the details; I cannot go into all the various texts such as those on the wheel of activities, consecration and offering rituals, ransoming the life-force, the empowerment rituals and Dharma teachings, but all of these details can be learned from the <em>Great Biography</em>.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> </p>
<p>In this way, this great Lord was, in this final five-hundred-year period, the sovereign of all the Bliss-Gone Ones, the Lord of the sixth familyâVajradharaâ and his kindness to disciples who are difficult to tame exceeds that of all the buddhas. In the guise of a great vajra master, he worked for the benefit of beings. With valid cognition, he proved the authenticity of the Words of the Buddha and subsequent treatises. All his written teachings, whose subjects are of great significance, are adapted to the needs of disciples and are like skilful means through which one can eliminate all the negative emotions of the three realms. He was an exalted being comparable to the blessed Buddha, who showed the path to the peace of nirvÄá¹a and taught the causes and results of all phenomena. As the Venerable Maitreya said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever speech is meaningful and properly connected with Dharma,<br/>
Which removes all afflictions of the three realms<br/>
And shows the benefit of peace,<br/>
Is the speech of the Sage, while any other speech is not.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The etymology is as follows: <em>subhÄá¹£ita</em> means eloquent speech. The sacred Dharma is good at the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end. It is excellent in meaning, excellent in words and syllables. It is distinctive. It is totally complete. It is utterly pure. It completely purifiesâ¦and so on.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> As for treatises, the Venerable Maitreya said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever those of perfectly undistracted mind have expounded,<br/>
Solely in accordance with the teaching of the Victorious One,<br/>
And conducive to the path for attaining liberation,<br/>
Should also be placed on the head, like the Buddhaâs own words.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, if the subject of a treatise is the teachings of the Buddha, and is in accordance with the path that leads to liberation, it should be viewed as being the same as the words of the Bliss-Gone One. The heart of all the teachings is the resultant Mantra Vehicle, and unsurpassed among all the piá¹­akas are the texts that principally discuss the inner generation, perfection and great perfection phases; one should know that these texts are similar to the Words of the Buddha, so excellently spoken. </p>
<p>Moreover, except for the practices of the Eight Great Maá¹á¸alas<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> and the Embodiment of the Guruâs Wisdom,<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> most of the activity manuals of the treasure revelations were composed with novice disciples of this degenerate age in mind. Yet because of that very clarity, most who rely only on the words are confused by what they appear to mean. In order to please the beings of these times, who are obsessed with words, the words of Jigme Lingpaâs writings are profound and of great meaning. Even those who are conceited as a result of their own intellectual games, no matter how many times they scrupulously analyze Jigme Lingpa writings, will find it difficult to fathom the depths of such profundity. These writings have the capacity to gradually lead anyone to the absolute space, and are very rare indeed. The power of the words and their meaning is such that intelligent people can understand them. They are so much more exalted than the treatises of other scholars, something that can be verified with direct perception. For future generations, these texts will become like pith instructions. In the holy land of India, right at the start of the later dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet and during the time of the six scholar-gatekeepers,<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a> the works of the great master AbhayÄkarapÄda<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> were considered more sublime than earlier treatises. So here, in the same way, if we are honest then we can understand that [Jigme Lingpaâs works are also more sublime than earlier treatises].</p>
<h3>[Patrons of the Derge Palace]</h3>
<p>The person who became the main cause for the publication of these excellent works, the original texts of this series of books, was the King of Derge.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> This king ruled over the âmaá¹á¸ala of the earthâ of Dokhamâs four rivers and six ranges. He was the guardian of the Dharma of this kingdom, like a wish-fulfilling tree amidst ordinary woodland. A mighty universal monarch, devoted to all the teachings and philosophical tenets of both the New and Ancient traditions of Tibet without bias, from those of the past through to those of the present, he made unsurpassable offerings and was the great patron of these eloquent writings that can now be found in this world. </p>
<p>In particular, when the excellent motivations and aspirations of the greatly revered Jigme Lingpa and the patron came together as one, the patron, [the King of Derge], was inspired by Jigme Lingpaâs scholarship and the spiritual accomplishments of his life and liberation. He became completely enchanted and could not help but place all his hope in Jigme Lingpa, who became his sole refuge. He served the sacred Dharma with great reverence and devotion, and through his offerings it was possible to publish Jigme Lingpaâs earlier writings. He provided his financial support everywhere, and as such his generosity for the Dharma was unheard of. Through his offerings he caused the interdependent circumstances to occur through which limitless doors [of Dharma] were opened, and the enlightened activities of the victorious ones did not go to waste. </p>
<p>The vajra prophecies of [Jigme Lingpaâs] mind treasure say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The venerable Queen Ngang Tsul of Phogyong<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, [Queen Tsewang Lhamo]<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a> was prophesied to be born as the princess Ngang Tsul Gyalmo. Later she was born as Queen Tsewang Lhamo, the consort and Dharma Queen of the King [of Derge, Sawang Zangpo]. She and [her son], the prince and Dharma King Tsewang Dorje Rigdzin and [daughter], the princess Tamdrin Wangmo,<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> had great faith in the teachings of the lord guru Jigme Lingpa. To prevent his teachings from diminishing, and so that they might flourish far and wide, they sponsored group practices of the great and glorious Peaceful and Wrathful Deities and VajrakÄ«laya at the newly established monastery in the region of Dza<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a> and the old monastic seats of Dzogchen, Gyalrong and Katok. They sponsored all these practices and prayers, and thus were worthy to be called great patrons of the Dharma. Because of the truth of the interdependent origination of the causes and results of these actions, which are undeceiving, and their perfect samaya [with Jigme Lingpa], and because of the bodhicitta and compassionate intention of their lord guru [Jigme Lingpa], he reincarnated as a supreme nirmÄá¹akÄya here. In fact, at this very moment the investiture ceremonies at the seat of his previous incarnation are being performed.<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a> As long as his enlightened activities endure, they will support him with their faith, influence and wealth.</p>
<h3>[Jigme Trinle Ãzer]</h3>
<p>The one who encouraged the compilation and publication of these earlier and later works was Jigme Trinle Ãzer. The vajra prophecies of [Jigme Lingpaâs] mind treasure say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An emanation of the prince will open the gateway to the Dharma.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This holy being, who was prophesied in this way, was born in the region of Shardo, one of the eighteen provinces of Dokham. From a young age, he practiced the instructions of MahÄmudrÄ and the Great Perfection. He received an ocean of ripening and liberating teachings and transmissions, and contemplated and meditated upon them extensively. He then stayed at sacred places such as Mount Kailash, absorbing himself in profound samÄdhi and practicing the skilful means of the Mantra Vehicle, through which he applied the key points of gathering the accumulations and purifying the obscurations, and penetrated to the depths of experience and realization. The spiritual friends he followed were all non-sectarian gurus, and from them he imbibed the nectar of the sacred Dharma in vast quantities. In particular, he met the Omniscient Guru [Jigme Lingpa], who had been the lord of his buddha-family throughout all his lives. Jigme Trinle Ãzer became his heart son and received all the teachings and transmissions, such as the old and new Heart-Essence, the Embodiment of the Guruâs Wisdom and the Great Collected [Nyingma] Tantras. He was entrusted with the ultimate teachings and crowned with the name Jigme Trinle Ãzer. He caused the Dharma and enlightened activities of Lord Guru Jigme Lingpa to flourish and spread throughout almost the whole of Dokham, all the way up to Gyalmorong in the East, thus becoming his true, great regent. He strongly urged the Great King and patron of the teachings to publish right away all the writings of the Omniscient Guru.<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> The son of the great king and his mother [the Queen Regent] were also delightedly agreed to this. Everyone who worked on the publication did so with utterly pure motivation and conduct in the beginning, the middle, and the end, and thus all the tasks required for the publication of the collected works were completed in an excellent manner. </p>

<h3>Volume Six</h3>
<p>Almost a hundred tantric KÄ«laya texts, translated by various lotsÄwas and paá¹á¸itas, can be found in the precious Collected Tantras of the Early Translation School. They have been gathered and condensed into the Tantra System VajrakÄ«laya, which is found in volume six.<a href="#fn:86" id="fnref:86" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[86]</a> An index can be found in that volume. </p>
<h3>Volume Seven</h3>
<p>Volumes seven and eight contain the texts of the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse, or the âNew Heart-Essenceâ, which hold the heart-essence of all the oceans of tantras and the quintessence of all the pith instructions related to the generation and perfection phases. The meaning of these mind treasures is profound, and their blessings swift. All the supplementary texts can be found here as well. A list of these texts is clearly set out in the catalogue <em>An Illuminating Ornament of Brilliant Sunlight</em>.<a href="#fn:87" id="fnref:87" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[87]</a> The first of these two volumes contains the sÄdhanas, activity manuals and background teachings which take the vase empowerment as the path and which relate mainly to the generation phase. </p>
<h3>Volume Eight</h3>
<p>Volume eight contains all the pith instructions and background teachings on how to take the three higher empowerments, such as the secret empowerment, as the path, and which relate mainly to the perfection phase.</p>
<h3>Volume Nine</h3>
<p>Volume nine contains <em>The Husk Containing Noble Deeds: The Life and Liberation of KyentsÃ© Ãzer</em>. This autobiography, which includes songs of realization, relates how Jigme Lingpa first received, read and contemplated the teachings, then practiced assiduously, and finally turned the wheel of enlightened activities. The meaning of his biography is summarized in <em>An Adornment of Songs of Realization</em>. Finally, this volume contains a collection of questions and answers on the meditation of the generation and perfection phases, and other spiritual advice. </p>
<h2>3. The Conclusion</h2>
<p>This consists of: 1) the benefit of this publication and 2) the conclusion by means of dedication and aspiration prayers.</p>
<h3>1. The Benefit of this Publication</h3>
<p>The <em>Verses that Summarize the Perfection of Wisdom, the Mother of the Victorious Ones</em>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to make stÅ«pas from the seven jewels that symbolize the complete nirvÄá¹a of the Bliss-Gone Ones and make offerings to them, and fill billions of realms, as many as the grains in the river Ganges, with them, and then, for example, all sentient beings in those billions of realms were to do nothing but make offerings of divine flowers, light incense, and anoint them during all the aeons of the past, present and future, or even better still, if one were to write down this Mother of the Bliss Gone Ones, the source of our Guides, the buddhas who are endowed with the ten strengths, if one were to hold it, cast flowers upon it and honour it, the merit of making offerings to such a stÅ«pa cannot equal this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compared to bringing all sentient beings in billions of realms numbering the grains of the river Ganges to the state of an arhat, if someone were to write down this transcendent perfection of insight, and then give the volume to an excellent sentient being, the merit of that would be far greater. Why? If supreme teachers train in this, they can reveal the emptiness of all phenomena. If ÅrÄvakas hear it, they will be swiftly liberated, pratyekabuddhas will reach their awakening and potential buddhas will reach awakening. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus this is explained extensively. Just as it is said that the benefit of printing the Words of the Bliss-Gone Ones, the transcendent perfection of insight, is immeasurable, in the same way the benefit of printing just one text that reveals the teachings of the pinnacle of all vehicles, the transcendental perfection of insight that ascertains the true nature of all phenomena, the Great Perfection, and the teachings that belong to the piá¹­aka of the profound Mantra Vehicle, the utterly profound path of the vidyÄdharas, is completely inexpressible. As long as a printed version of texts with such inexhaustible qualities remains, the benefit will endure. You should also know that the benefit of listening to a teaching based on such a text and contemplating and meditating on it is immeasurable. Likewise, concerning the benefit of giving a Dharma text to someone else, the <em>Extensive Mother</em><a href="#fn:88" id="fnref:88" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[88]</a> scripture says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âKauÅika,<a href="#fn:89" id="fnref:89" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[89]</a> from all the beings that exist in all the billions of universes, if you were to lead some of them, sons or daughters of noble family, to the four meditative concentrations, the four immeasurables, the four formless absorptions, or the five super-cognitions, KauÅika, what do you think? The merit of those sons or daughters of noble family, would it not be a lot?â </p>
<p>The Blessed One said: âIf a son or daughter of noble family were to give a text of the transcendental perfection of insight such as this to someone else in order to read, write out or recite, their merit would be much greater still. Why is that so? KauÅika, this transcendental perfection of insight teaches the undefiled dharmas extensively. To train in thatâ¦you will awaken as a completely perfect buddha.â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, you should understand it to be just as stated here by the Buddha. </p>
<h3>2. Stanzas for Dedication and Aspiration</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Svasti bhavatu!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>From the great icy ocean<a href="#fn:90" id="fnref:90" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[90]</a> of the Lord of Sages, perfect in abandonment and realization,<br/>
Arose the twelve perfect insights of cessation, the path, and so on.<a href="#fn:91" id="fnref:91" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[91]</a><br/>
Homage to the liberating sacred Dharma, which, like the moon<br/>
Or the surface of fresh camphor, dispels our darkness. </p></li>
<li><p>The truth of the path, affording the taste of peace and removing the suffering of saá¹sÄra,<br/>
Has taken the form of names, syllables and words,<br/>
And been printed with sublime intention, the magic of which<br/>
Allows one text to be multiplied into many. Through this merit, </p></li>
<li><p>The merit of all the good actions that arise<br/>
From listening, contemplating and meditating,<br/>
And all the merit from the past, present and future of all beings gathered together,<br/>
May we enter the great ocean of the four kÄyas of omniscience! </p></li>
<li><p>Through the power of this merit, may the fire of suffering,<br/>
Sprung from the thickets of the view of self, the cause of the unendurable sufferings of the hells,<br/>
And intensified by the fierce winds of bad karma, be extinguished,<br/>
So that all may attain excellent rebirths in higher realms. </p></li>
<li><p>May the hungry ghosts as well be liberated from their torment,<br/>
Internally, of hunger and thirst, and externally, of the extremity of the seasons.<br/>
May their happiness, glory and wealth know no bounds,<br/>
And may they enjoy the glorious wealth of the higher realms. </p></li>
<li><p>May the endarkening vines and vegetation<br/>
Of animalsâ ignorance and servitude be cut down,<br/>
And the sharp weapon of discerning knowledge<br/>
Bring them the sacred, illuminating insight of selflessness. </p></li>
<li><p>May human beings, by means of the excellent boat<br/>
Of the freedoms and advantages, cross the four rivers,<a href="#fn:92" id="fnref:92" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[92]</a><br/>
Travel to the jewelled island of supreme liberation,<br/>
And there take possession of the gem of supreme bliss. </p></li>
<li><p>May the hostility of the asuras, which is so difficult for them to bear<br/>
And leads to conflict, be doused by the waters of loving kindness.<br/>
May they only assist one another, just like friends or relatives,<br/>
And through bodhicitta, come to find a state of genuine tranquility. </p></li>
<li><p>May the gods who are intoxicated by their desires<br/>
Realize that craving for objects is a cause of bondage,<br/>
And seeing things as hollow, like the moonâs reflection,<br/>
May they set out joyfully on the path to nirvÄá¹a. </p></li>
<li><p>May all beings, bewildered by the view of personhood<br/>
And plagued by desire and other emotions, as if trapped<br/>
In the jaws of a crocodile, be able to release themselves<br/>
And attain a state of conscientiousness and calm. </p></li>
<li><p>As if tricked by a mirage, childish beings are never content<br/>
With their own possessions, and the weapon of their animosity<br/>
Makes them jealous of othersâ wealth and successâ<br/>
May their coarseness of thought and deed subside. </p></li>
<li><p>May bodhicitta awaken in the minds of spirits as well,<br/>
Enabling them to protect all beings.<br/>
May degeneration of the environment and its inhabitants be naturally pacified<br/>
And the splendour of the Age of Perfection gladden the world. </p></li>
<li><p>At the end of time the illusory net of the buddhas manifests in the form of masters,<br/>
A gathering of vidyÄdharas whose armour of bodhicitta<br/>
Is impervious to the forces of darkness,<br/>
And who beautify the earth with their qualities of knowledge and liberation. </p></li>
<li><p>When the supreme essential teachings were in decline on this earth,<br/>
May the kingdom of NÄrÄyaá¹a,<a href="#fn:93" id="fnref:93" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[93]</a> whose courage is indomitable,<br/>
The lord of Dergeâland of the four pursuits<a href="#fn:94" id="fnref:94" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[94]</a> and the ten virtuesâ<br/>
And of his Queen and family, never decline in excellence. </p></li>
<li><p>May their lifespan, Dharma, wealth and family line never diminish.<br/>
May their abundant fortune expand like a lake in summertime,<br/>
May they sustain all beings as magnificently as Mount Meru,<br/>
And may they be universally victorious and conquer the whole world. </p></li>
<li><p>As the tree of giving is irrigated by the waters of compassion<br/>
Its fruits of munificence prosper, and in its cooling shade<br/>
The wishes of all beings are fulfilled, may the pÄramitÄ<br/>
Of enthusiastic and honest generosity be perfected! </p></li>
<li><p>Restrained by vows that control the senses and eliminate negativity,<br/>
Beings take delight in a state of tranquilityâ<br/>
May the pÄramitÄ of pure and pristine discipline,<br/>
A treasure trove of millions of stainless qualities, be perfected! </p></li>
<li><p>Seeing things as an illusion, and for othersâ benefit,<br/>
Never shirking from the most difficult of tasks,<br/>
In which one thinks little of sacrificing even life and limbâ<br/>
May the pÄramitÄ of sublime patience be perfected! </p></li>
<li><p>With a stable commitment to deliver all beings,<br/>
Who resemble an optical illusion, to nirvÄá¹a,<br/>
And undefeated by the forces of laziness and doubtâ<br/>
May the pÄramitÄ of steadfast diligence be perfected! </p></li>
<li><p>Within the ocean of samÄdhi, unsullied by conceptual elaboration<br/>
And undisturbed by the turbulent waves of thought,<br/>
Is a treasure with the flavour of joyous bliss and realizationâ<br/>
May we obtain the pÄramitÄ of meditative concentration! </p></li>
<li><p>With the stainless blade of the view of selflessness<br/>
That cuts through the vines of ordinary concepts,<br/>
And with the treasures of memory and courageous eloquence,<br/>
May we obtain the pÄramitÄ of insight that discerns all things! </p></li>
<li><p>Unhindered as we lead all beings towards liberation,<br/>
Accepted by a sublime protector and serving him devotedly,<br/>
Through mastery of the archery of oceanic ripening and liberation,<br/>
May we defeat the adversarial forces of existence! </p></li>
<li><p>With all the adventitious faults, misdeeds and downfalls<br/>
That obscure the sun of our own true face, the buddha nature, entirely purified,<br/>
May our realization of the five pathsâincluded within the four vidyÄdhara levelsâincrease,<br/>
And may we realize the true meaning of the ground! </p></li>
<li><p>May anyone connected to these efforts of body, speech and mind<br/>
Experience only the exhaustion of bad karma and its results,<br/>
And may they be among the very first circle of disciples<br/>
Of the Buddha âCompletely Victoriousâ,<a href="#fn:95" id="fnref:95" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[95]</a> foremost among humans! </p></li>
<li><p>May the realizations of the path that arise from listening, contemplating<br/>
And meditating on these works increase like the waxing moon,<br/>
And may these successive volumes of teachings<br/>
Adorn the throats of the vidyÄdharas upon this earth! </p></li>
<li><p>Not focusing on those to whom this is dedicated or the one who dedicates, but with space-like non-conceptuality<br/>
And seeing the dedication itself as like someone in a dream casting flowers in the skyâ<br/>
May we emulate the dedication of the supremely noble, who see reality beyond reference,<br/>
And thus may the longed-for result come about, and our dedication be entirely pure! </p></li>

<p>Since Getse Mahapandita mentions the catalogue of the Longchen Nyingtik written by Jigme Losal Ãzer, <em>An Illuminating Ornament of Brilliant Sunlight: A Catalogue of the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse</em>, which was written in 1802, we must infer that this text was written either in 1802 or slightly later. Janet Gyatso mentions the request, probably in 1798, from the Derge kingdom to Jigme Lingpa to send authoritative copies of some of his writings to them. Given the date of the catalogue, we can estimate that the Derge edition of Jigme Lingpa's collected works must have been produced roughly between 1798 and 1802. See also Sam van Schaik, <em>Approaching the Great Perfection</em>, p. 39 and Janet Gyatso, <em>Apparitions of the Self</em>, p. 310, n. 2. <a href="#fnref:96" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
